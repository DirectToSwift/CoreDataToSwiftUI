</h2>

This directory contains enhancements so that ZeeQL KeyValueCoding can be used
together with 
[SwiftUIRules](https://github.com/DirectToSwift/SwiftUIRules/blob/develop/README.md),
and that NSPredicates can be used as rule predicates.

It also comes with a rule parser which can parse and build rule models 
dynamically.
